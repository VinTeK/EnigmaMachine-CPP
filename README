Simulation of an Enigma machine.

Note that double stepping has not been implemented due to laziness.

Included is a ncurses interface that allows you to interact with the machine.

Simply type 'make' to build the ncurses version.

Usage:
    left & right
	select a rotor to manually move.
    up & down
	rotate the selected rotor.
    F2
	randomize the currently selected rotor.
    F3
	randomize plugboard, reflector, and rotors.
    F4
	quit the program.

Argument passing:
    -h
	print the usage message and exit.

    -r ROTOR_CONFIGURATION
	set the rotors to some initial positions. (example: '-r FOO' would set the rotors, from left to right, to 'F', 'O', and 'O'.)
